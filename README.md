# ANNUAL PERMIT

The web page where company personnel can take their annual leave and see their information.

I realized this project during my internship.

People with the same project cannot get permission at the same time.
The system checks this and sends an error message in case of conflict.

The administrator can approve the permissions by logging in as admin. It can assign new projects to personnel and create new projects.
